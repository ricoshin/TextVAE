 shares of ual the parent of united airlines were extremely active all day friday reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ N billion buy-out of the airline by an <unk> group
 wall street 's takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and ual stock would rise
 at N p.m. edt came the <unk> news the big board was <unk> trading in ual pending news
 on the exchange floor as soon as ual stopped trading we <unk> for a panic said one top floor trader
 several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news <unk>
 for weeks the market had been nervous about takeovers after campeau corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers

 without the <unk> of stock-index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board
 the futures halt was even <unk> by big board floor traders
 it <unk> things up said one major specialist
 this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings
 in a stock-index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference
 when the airline information came through it <unk> every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms
 we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do

 futures traders say the s&p was <unk> that the dow could fall as much as N points
 during this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun

 but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today
 the <unk> between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation
 the big board 's mr. <unk> said our <unk> performance was good
 but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks
 obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <unk> obligations were n't met he said
