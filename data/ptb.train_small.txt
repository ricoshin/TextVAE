 a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than N years ago researchers reported
 the asbestos fiber <unk> is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said
 <unk> inc. the unit of new york-based <unk> corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in N
 although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem
 a <unk> <unk> said this is an old story
 we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties
 there is no asbestos in our products now
 neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes
 we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said james a. <unk> of boston 's <unk> cancer institute
 dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university
 the <unk> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of <unk> in N
 from N to N N billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said
 among N men who worked closely with the substance N have died more than three times the expected number
 four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer
 the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said
 the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk>
 the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said
 the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters
 the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said
 the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine
 more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained
 in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos
 by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed
 about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s
 areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used
 workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters
 workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area
 there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk>
 but you have to recognize that these events took place N years ago
 it has no bearing on our work force today
